# SourceGPT

[![MIT](https://img.shields.io/packagist/l/doctrine/orm.svg?maxAge=2592000?style=plastic)](https://github.com/NightmareLab/SourceGPT/blob/main/LICENSE)

SourceGPT - source code analyzer and prompt manager built on top of ChatGPT as the oracle. 

## Overview
With SourceGPT, you can upload your source code as a zip file, select the prompt model you want to use, and then retrieve the results all through a user-friendly web interface. SourceGPT can be self-hosted. Use cases: you want to test a prompt model, Lexical analysis,  code scan, etc.

The project is far from being perfect and does contain also some limitations, please before going further read the project's github documentation at <a href="https://github.com/NightmareLab/SourceGPT#start-guide"> https://github.com/NightmareLab/SourceGPT </a>
